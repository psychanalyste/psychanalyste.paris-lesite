Drawing the night sky, stars, galaxies, planets, and other celestial bodies is a ton of fun with the Paper iPad app by FiftyThree. Much like drawing blue skies and clouds, it is very hard to screw them up if you follow a few simple guidelines.

In this Paper tutorial I'll take you through my process for painting an outer space scene using only my finger. In the second half of this guide I'll demonstrate how to paint another scene, but with FiftyThree's Pencil stylus instead. Taking advantage of Surface Pressure and Blend the effects are easier and faster to pull off.

Oh and I'm trying something different this time. I've toyed around with including short how-to videos before, but this time I made a complete record of the process. Using captures directly from the iPad and an iPhone pointed at my hands and screen, I show an uninterupted cut from start to finish. Each video is fully anotated with notes and tips, so be sure to watch directly on Youtube.com to see them.

And with that let's get started.

## Painting outer space with your finger

### Cover the canvas

Start by covering the canvas with a dark color. For this technique to work properly you need to fill it manually. The page fill "shortcut" won't work properly.

### Star clusters and flow

Use white or a tint to lighten the dark background and lay the ground work for the composition. Using a photographic reference helps, but you can free form it and just let it happen as you glide your finger across the canvas.

To create smooth tones keep your finger on the screen and use a circular motion to blend out the edges. You're trying to avoid harsh edges as much as you can.

For areas that are dense with stars apply multiple layers to brighten them up.

ProTip: Zoom-in to paint thinner strokes and fill smaller shapes.

#### Blue glazes

Starting with a light blue glaze over the lighten areas to the left. You don't have to worry about being precise since it will only show on the white areas. Because we filled in the background with a black color earlier it is already at its darkest point and adding more color to it won't change that.

Use the same technique as before with the white color. Keep your strokes controlled and smooth. If as you paint an area doesn't appear to smoothen out move your finger slower, and be sure not to lift it off the screen for more than a second. Doing so will indicate to Paper that a new stroke was made and you will see a visible seam between the values.

To create the illusion of depth add more glaze layers towards the outsides of the shapes. This will leave pockets of lightness in the center where we will tap in stars later.

Feel free to adjust the darkness of the color by using the color slider. Don't go too far with it though. Multiple layers of a light color generally looks better than a single dark color layer.

#### Fuchsia glazes

Repeat the exact same process on the right half of the composition now, but with a fuchsia or violet hue. When you finish you should have something that vaguely resembles this.

If you went to dark anywhere mix a tint of blue or fuchsia (depending on where you want to lighten) and dab your finger quickly to pull out some color. Use your best judgment and correct as needed. There may be some back and forth between the tint and a darker color to get the gradient just right.

ProTip: Move quickly when using a watercolor brush loaded with white. Go too slow and it'll turn a pure white way too fast.

### Placing stars with your fingers

Now begins the tedious process of placing stars one by one. I like to star with a medium to dark color that is in the family of the area I'm placing it. So if we start on the blue side first you'll want to mix up a star color that is... blue --- what a shocker! Using the Paper's Color Picker makes things so much easier. Just sample a blue spot you painted earlier and then manipulate the sliders to get it's intensity just right.

Try to use your fingertip with a controlled tapping motion. If you strike the screen and drag your finger in the slightest a small streak will appear instead of a dot. If this happens just use the two finger Rewind gesture to undo the mistake.

The more stars you add the greater the effect. It also helps to vary the size of the stars and increase the lightness as you go. I strongly suggest avoid using any tool except the pencil. It is semi transparent and looks more natural than the pens.

Tapping in the same spot a few times is an affective way of brightening a star. Using your finger tip isn't that accurate so it can take a few Rewinds to get the placement just right.

The same technique can be used to create larger stars. Place a bunch of pencil dots next to each other to give the illusion of a larger one.

As before when you move over to the fuchsia and violet half of the space scene, switch your star color to match. Glazes can be applied to darken patches of stars to add some more dimension as well The same goes for using white to lighten an area. There really is no right or wrong way to approach it, so feel free to experiment and find what works best for you.

### Two worlds

Our space scene wouldn't be complete without a planet or two, so let's remedy that.

The hardest part to world building is deciding where to place the planet. Since I've keep the composition cut in half for the most part seems to make the most sense if we place a planet on each side.

Mix up a white or tint and switch to the fountain pen tool. Then simply place your finger on the canvas where you'd like the planet to appear and hold it for a few seconds. The longer you hold the larger the dot that is made.

I'm placing my planet off to the right in the violet portion of space so I'll want to mix up a similar hue. Using the watercolor brush, paint glazes over the white dot gradually moving further and further away from one of the edges. In this example I'm moving towards the left to leave a highlight on the right edge.

Continue adding glazes until one side fades completely into the darkness of space. To speed up the process increase the darkness of the color you're painting with.

Once you're satisfied with the results repeat the process for as many other planets as you need.

## Drawing outer space with Pencil

Building on the same techniques used in the first half of this guide, I'm going to now show you how Pencil can be used to enhance and speed up the process. For the most part you follow the exact same steps with a few embellishments here and there to ratchet up the realism in the piece.
