Eko Wave, a company started by [two](http://twitter.com/endonend) [pals](http://twitter.com/bjpmba) and myself, just took the wraps off our first app --- [**Relic Scout**](http://relicscout.com). Last week we launched a teaser site and couldn't be prouder of the work that we've done so far.

I had a lot of fun creating the 8bit pixel art and applying a parallax effect to it using the [jQuery plugin Plax](https://github.com/cameronmcefee/plax). If you collect sports cards, magic cards, coins, or comics, you really should check it out.
